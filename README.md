# Hey there 👋 I'm Ha Won!

I'm a computer science student with a growing passion for backend development.  
Currently diving deep into **Spring Boot**, building solid server-side applications and exploring how backend systems work.  
I mostly work with **MySQL** as my go-to database, and I'm always eager to learn better ways to structure and manage data.

This GitHub is where I’ll be documenting my journey — one project at a time.  
I'm excited for all the things I’ll create, learn, and share along the way. 🚀
